# Clustering-and-fitting
This dataset has 7,668 movies with 15 attributes of each movie, including name, rating, genre, release year, runtime, and financial information such as budget and gross revenue. Additional columns are metrics about audience and critic views, such as scores and vote count on IMDb, and metadata like the director, writer, and production company. While the dataset is rich in information, there are some attributes that contain missing values, especially in the budget and gross columns, which may require preprocessing prior to analysis.
Statistical Overview: There are interesting patterns in the statistical overview. The movies range from 1980 to 2020, with an average release year of 2001. The average IMDb score is 6.39, with most movies receiving between 5.8 and 7.1. Financial data is highly variable: budgets range from $6,000 to $356 million, and gross earnings range from $309 to $2.85 billion. Votes are heavily skewed, with a few very popular movies receiving millions of votes. Runtime statistics are that most movies run about 108 minutes, with some outliers running as long as 271 minutes. This dataset forms a strong basis for analyzing trends related to movie production, audience reception, and box office performance..
